Geo-Cloudmade version 0.7
==========================

This module is a wrapper for access to Cloudmade's geo service.
Cloudmade is a provider of FREE map of the world. http://www.cloudmade.com

For now the following features were implemented:
 - geocoding and geosearching - http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/geocoding-http-api
 - routing - http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/routing-http-api
 - obtaining tiles - http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/tiles/documents

Please note that this module provided "as-is" without any warranty. 

You can find some examples of usage by command 'perldoc Geo::Cloudmade' after installation of the module.
Ideally, you should request API key for access to Cloudmade's servers, but for now sample key works well.
